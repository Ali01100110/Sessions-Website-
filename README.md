# Sessions Organizer Website
 As a college student with multiple courses scheduled throughout the day, I am seeking a user-friendly website or platform that will allow me to efficiently track my upcoming course sessions. Specifically, I would like a system where I can easily view:

1) The day of the week for each class.
2) The start time of each session.
3) Any additional relevant details and the link of the session.

This tool would help me manage my schedule more effectively and ensure I am always prepared for my next class. I would appreciate any guidance or resources you could provide to help me create or access such a system.  

in Addition this website is responsive website.
